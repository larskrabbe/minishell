        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Minishell project is a complex and challenging project that requires the students to develop their problem-solving skills and to think critically about how to design and implement a shell program. It helps them develop their ability to read and understand documentation, implement complex data structures, and handle different types of inputs and outputs. Overall, the Minishell project is a great opportunity for students to put their programming skills into practice and develop a useful tool that can be used in their everyday life.

      <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
            Our Minishell has the following features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Displays a prompt when waiting for a new command.
            </li>
            <li>
                Has a working history.
            </li>
            <li>
                Searches and launches the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path).
            </li>
            <li>
                Does not use more than one global variable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Does not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).
            </li>
            <li>
                Handles â€™ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence.
            </li>
            <li>
                Handles " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
            </li>
            <li>
                Implements redirections: < should redirect input, > should redirect output, << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the delimiter is seen, and >> should redirect output in append mode.
            </li>
            <li>
                Handles environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which should expand to their values.
            </li>
            <li>
                Handles $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground command.
            </li>
            <li>
                Handles ctrl-C, ctrl-D, and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
            </li>
            <li>
                In interactive mode, ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line, ctrl-D exits the shell, and ctrl-\ does nothing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implements built-in commands: echo with option -n, cd with only a relative or absolute path, pwd with no options, export with no options, unset with no options, env with no options or arguments, and exit with no options.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Built-in Commands</h2>
        <p>
            Our Minishell implements the following built-in commands:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                echo with option -n
            </li>
            <li>
                cd with only a relative or absolute path
            </li>
            <li>
                pwd with no options
            </li>
            <li>
                export with no options
            </li>
            <li>
                unset with no options
            </li>
            <li>
                env with no options or arguments
            </li>
            <li>
                exit with no options
            </li>
